## Impact:
Customer segmentation projects have a significant impact on a company's marketing and product development strategies.
By understanding customer characteristics and needs in more depth, companies can improve customer experience, 
optimize marketing strategies, and increase customer retention.

In addition, with effective customer segmentation, companies can improve resource efficiency and marketing budget allocation, focusing on the most profitable and 
high-potential segmentations. This in turn can increase the company's profitability and strengthen its competitive position in the market. 
Thus, customer segmentation projects are not just about understanding customers better, but also about improving overall business performance 
and strengthening long-term relationships with customers.
