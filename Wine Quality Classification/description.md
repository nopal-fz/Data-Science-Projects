## Project Overview
This data science project aims to classify the quality of wine with a data set that contains calories, alcohol, citric acid and others. With a total of 1,143 rows and 13 columns, this project seeks to identify the key variables that have the most significant impact on wine quality.

## Data Dictionary:

| Variable          | Description                                                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| fixed acidity     | The concentration of non-volatile acids                    |
| volatile acidity  | The concentration of non-volatile acids                    |
| citric acid       | The concentration of citric acid                           |
| residual sugar    | The amount of sugar remaining in the wine                  |
| chlorides         | The concentration of chlorides in the wine                 |
| free sulfur       | The concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2)                  |
| total sulfur      | The concentration of both free and bound sulfur dioxide    |
| density           | The density of the wine                                    |
| pH                | The measure of acidity or basicity of the wine             |
| sulphates         | The concentration of sulfur dioxide salts                  |
| alcohol           | The percentage of alcohol by volume                        |
| quality           | A subjective score given to the wine                       |

## Impact
This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can estimate the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties and sensory attributes. In the target column there are two values, the first is 1 to represent that the quality is good and then 0 to represent poor quality.
